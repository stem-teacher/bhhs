## **Specification Process Overview**

The **specification process** is a critical phase in software engineering that focuses on defining, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. Guided by industry standards such as **SWEBOK v3** (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) and the **IEEE 830-1998 Requirements Standard**, this process involves gathering functional, non-functional, and security requirements to create a clear, detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS). An effective specification process ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system's goals, features, and constraints, laying the foundation for successful design, development, and validation. In this section, you will explore best practices and methodologies to produce comprehensive, traceable, and modifiable specifications that align with user needs and project objectives.
