Requirements definition and management REQM
Managing requirements through the entire delivery and operational life cycle.

Guidance notes
Requirements may be related to software, systems, data, processes, products or services.
Activities may include — but are not limited to:
eliciting and analysing requirements — both functional and non-functional
ensuring that customer requirements and priorities are accurately reflected
organising and prioritising requirements using techniques such as — but not limited to — product roadmaps, epics, user stories and backlogs
specifying and validating requirements and constraints to a level that enables effective development and operations of new or changed software, systems, processes, products or services
negotiating trade-offs that are acceptable to key stakeholders and within budgetary, technical, regulatory, and other constraints
adopting and adapting requirements management life cycle models.
The requirements life cycle approach will be based on the context of the work and may be selected from predictive (plan-driven) or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.


# Requirements definition and management: Level 1
This skill is not typically observed or practiced at this level of responsibility and accountability.

# Requirements definition and management: Level 2
Uses standard techniques to elicit, specify, and document requirements for simple subject areas with clearly-defined boundaries.

Assists in the definition and management of requirements.

Assists in the creation of a requirements baseline.

Assists in investigating and applying authorised changes.

# Requirements definition and management: Level 3
Defines and manages scoping, requirements definition and prioritisation activities for small-scale changes and assists with more complex change initiatives.

Follows agreed standards and applies appropriate techniques to elicit and document detailed requirements. Provides constructive challenge to stakeholders as required. Reviews requirements for errors and omissions.

Prioritises requirements and documents traceability to source.

Provides input to the requirements base-line. Investigates, manages and applies authorised requests for changes to base-lined requirements, in line with change management policy.

## SFIA Testing
https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/testing
Guidance notes
The scope of testing includes technology, system components, configurations, packages and their interfaces. This skill is applicable to all testing methodologies — which can be delivered using predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.
Activities may include — but are not limited to:
planning, designing, managing, executing and reporting of tests
functional testing of capabilities or features
non-functional testing of qualities such as — but not limited to — performance, security, access, backup and recovery, archiving and retention, robustness, availability, capacity, scalability, reliability, performance, stress, volume, maintainability and portability
static testing and static analysis
managing risks associated with testing and taking preventative action when needed
adopting and adapting testing methods including waterfall, incremental or agile approaches
conforming to agreed process standards, industry-specific regulations and data protection legislation
engineering, using and maintaining testware to measure and improve the quality of the software being tested
promoting productivity through test automation, tools and best practices
developing scalable and reliable automated tests and frameworks.

# Level 1
Executes given manual test scripts under supervision.

Uses basic automated testing tools.

Records results and reports issues.

Develops an understanding of the role of testing as a tool for design improvement and a validation process.

# Testing: Level 2
Designs test cases, creates test scripts and test data, and automates repeatable tasks working to the requirements or specifications provided.

Defines test conditions for given requirements.

Executes and records manual and automated testing in accordance with test plans.

Analyses and reports on test activities, results, issues and risks.

# Testing: Level 3
Designs test cases and test scripts under own direction, mapping back to pre-determined criteria, recording and reporting test outcomes.

Participates in requirement, design and specification reviews, and uses this information to design test plans and test conditions.

Applies agreed standards to specify and perform manual and automated testing. Automates testing tasks and builds test coverage through existing or new infrastructure.

Analyses and reports on test activities, results, issues and risks.

# Testing: Level 4
Selects appropriate testing approach, including manual and automated testing.

Develops and executes test plans and test cases. Implements scalable and reliable automated tests and frameworks.

Collaborates across parties involved in product, systems or service design and development to enable comprehensive test coverage. Identifies improvements in requirements, design or specification processes to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of testing.

Analyses and reports on test activities, results, issues and risks, including the work of others.
