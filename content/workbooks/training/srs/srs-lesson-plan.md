## Lesson Plan

### Stages/Timing
Work with each student in more consulting fashion to achieve results.
## Lesson Outline

### 0-5 Minutes: Introduction

- **Objective:** Introduce the concept of System Requirements Specification (SRS).
- **Activities:**
  - Welcome students and briefly introduce the day's topic.
  - Pose an opening question: _“What do you think is the first step in building software?”_
  - Explain that creating a **System Requirements Specification (SRS)** is one of the first and most critical steps.

---

### 5-15 Minutes: What is an SRS?

- **Objective:** Define what an SRS is and discuss its context in software engineering.
- **Content:**
  - Present the definition of an SRS:
    - _“A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) forms a contractual basis between a customer and the software engineering team, detailing what the system should do.”_
  - Show a **Context Diagram** from SWEBOK to illustrate the role of SRS in software development.
  - Discuss the **context** of using an SRS in different scenarios, from large organizations building software for clients to individuals instructing an AI.
- **Questions:**
  - _“Why do you think having a clear set of requirements is important when building software?”_

---

### 15-25 Minutes: Understanding Software Requirements

- **Objective:** Explain what software requirements are and introduce various types.
- **Content:**
  - Define a software requirement and differentiate between:
    - **Functional Requirements:** What the system should do.
    - **Non-Functional Requirements:** How the system performs.
    - **Security Requirements:** How the system protects data and interactions.
  - **Examples:**
    - Functional: _"The system must allow students to register for events online."_
    - Non-Functional: _"The system should load event details within 2 seconds."_
    - Security: _"User passwords must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption."_
- **Activity:**
  - Ask students to write down one simple functional requirement for a school event management system.

---

### 25-35 Minutes: Gathering Requirements & Standards

- **Objective:** Discuss where requirements come from and introduce software standards.
- **Content:**
  - Explain **Requirements Sources**:
    - Stakeholders (e.g., users, clients).
    - Business needs and goals.
    - Regulations and standards.
  - Introduce the concept of **Standards** in software engineering.
    - Describe what standards are and their role in ensuring software quality.
    - Introduce **ACSC ISM (Australian Cyber Security Centre's Information Security Manual)** as a key security standard.
- **Activity:**
  - Display the class Hugo site and showcase a section on software standards.

### 35-45 Minutes: Characteristics of a Good SRS

- **Objective:** Highlight the key characteristics of a well-defined SRS.
- **Content:**
  - Discuss the **8 characteristics of a good SRS**:
    - **Correct:** Accurately describes the intended functionality.
    - **Unambiguous:** Clear and interpreted in only one way.
    - **Complete:** Covers all necessary aspects.
    - **Consistent:** No conflicting requirements.
    - **Ranked:** Prioritized by importance or stability.
    - **Verifiable:** Can be tested or inspected.
    - **Modifiable:** Easy to update and maintain.
    - **Traceable:** Each requirement can be tracked throughout the project.
  - Emphasize the use of **"must"** statements for mandatory requirements.
- **Activity:**
  - Have students refine the functional requirement they wrote earlier to make it unambiguous and verifiable.

### 45-50 Minutes: Traceability & What to Avoid in SRS

- **Objective:** Explain traceability and what not to include in an SRS.
- **Content:**
  - Define **Traceability**: The ability to track a requirement through its implementation and testing.
  - Introduce traceability elements: ID, Type, Description, Importance.
  - **What to Avoid:**
    - Do not include design details.
    - Avoid vague language.
    - Keep project management aspects separate.
- **Questions:**
  - _“Why is it important to track each requirement?”_
- **Activity:**
  - Show a sample SRS statement on the Hugo site that includes traceability elements.

---

### 50-60 Minutes: How Requirements Fit into the Software Engineering Lifecycle

- **Objective:** Place SRS in the context of the overall software engineering process.
- **Content:**
  - Explain how SRS fits into different phases:
    - **Planning:** Defines scope and project goals.
    - **Construction:** Guides developers on what to build.
    - **Testing:** Used to verify that the final product meets the requirements.
- **Wrap-Up:**
  - Summarize the importance of a well-defined SRS.
  - Emphasize that good requirements form the backbone of successful software projects.

---

### Homework / Follow-Up Activity

- **Activity:** Ask students to create three requirements (one functional, one non-functional, one security) for a simple system they choose. They should:
  - Write them using the SRS template in Markdown.
  - Save them in their GitHub repository.
  - Commit the link with the teacher for feedback.


## Reflection

1. What assumptions did I make when I planned this lesson?

Assumed the Y11 boys would show up with the correct equipment - or a backup.
Jayla had her equipment and was able to undertake her work.

1. Were these assumptions correct/incorrect?
No.

1. What impact did these assumptions have on the effectiveness of the lesson?
Boys could not do their work and had to go to backup.

1. How could I do things differently next time?

### What Were the Most Effective Elements of the Lesson?
Lab went well for Jalya and the boys got more focus on their efforts.

### What Were the Least Effective Elements of the Lesson?
Lack of equipment.

### If I Was to Repeat the Lesson, What Would I Change? What Could I Improve?
In this one, it is really up to the students to bring their materials.
