## Overview
**Name:** Philip Haynes **Date:** 28/09/2024
**School:** Broken Hill High School

**Unit of Work:** Programming Fundamentals
**Lesson Topic:** Introduction to Software Testing **Lesson Length:** 60 mins

**Lesson Begins / End:** 9:05:10:05 **Class Size:** 20

## Syllabus Outcomes
1. **SE-11-01**: Describes methods used to plan, develop and engineer software solutions
Introduce Students to the use of SRS in the context of a formal software engineering.

1. **SE-11-02**: explains how structural elements are used to develop programming code
Demonstrate how requirements tracde to implementation.

1. **SE-11-03**: Describes how current hardware, software and emerging technologies influence the  development of software engineering solutions
Demonstrate a contemporary software engineering environment.

1. **SE-11-04**: applies safe and secure practices to collect, use and store data
Continued demonstration to students to the use of [github](https://github.com/stem-teacher/brokenhill-h.github.io)

1. **SE-11-06**: applies tools and resources to design, develop, manage and evaluate software
Introduce students to key software technologies to complete software engineering.

1. **SE-11-07**: Implements safe and secure programming solutions
Introduce students to the [ISM Security Controls](https://ism.mentormind.com.au/control/index)

## Lesson Outcomes
- Understand the importance of software testing.
- Identify different types of testing and their purposes.
- Comprehend key testing concepts like test coverage and requirements traceability matrix (RTM).
- Recognize the role of testing in the software engineering process.
- Develop basic skills in creating test plans, test cases, and RTMs.

## Assessment (Diagnostic/Formative/Summative)
This is an inital subject with a lot of material for students to understand.
The goal is to ensure students can access and explore the information, then complete the initial task of creating test material.
- **Formative Assessment:** Evaluate students' participation during discussions and hands-on exercises.
- **Summative Assessment:** Review the test plans, test cases, and RTMs created during the hands-on exercise.

## Key Vocabulary
- Software Testing
- Bug/Defect
- Debugging
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing
- Regression Testing
- Automation

## The Key/Foundational Ideas Addressed in This Lesson Are
1. SRS in the context of a formal software engineering process.

## General Capabilities
The class consists of main stream Y11 students. Bright and enthusasistic, but otherwise new to software engineering.

## Equipment/Resources
- [Presentation pack](/workbooks/training/test/bhhs-test.pptx)
- Students have access to a computer and are logged into GitHub.
- Prepared [software engineering site](https://brokenhill-h.polemos.ai/)
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/stem-teacher/brokenhill-h.github.io): A version control platform where students will store their Test documents.
- **Exercise:** Refer to the [Test Exercise](/workbooks/training/test/bhhs-test-exercise).
- Presentation slides on software testing concepts.
- Access to GitHub Codespace for hands-on exercises.

## Context of the Lesson/Students' Prior Learning:
The students have been introduced to git and github, but otherwise new to the subject.

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)
- **Activity:** Brief discussion on what students know about software testing.
- **Objective:** Gauge prior knowledge and set the stage for the lesson.

### 2. Software Testing Overview and Fundamentals (10 minutes)
- **Activity:** Presentation covering:
  - Definition of software testing.
  - Reasons why testing is crucial.
  - Key terminology: testing, bug/defect, debugging.
- **Objective:** Establish a foundational understanding of testing.

### 3. Testing Levels (10 minutes)
- **Activity:** Explain different levels of testing:
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - System Testing
  - Acceptance Testing
  - Regression Testing
- **Objective:** Familiarize students with various testing stages.

### 4. Kiddy Testing and Its Challenges (5 minutes)
- **Activity:** Discuss "Kiddy Testing" and its limitations.
- **Objective:** Highlight the need for structured testing approaches.

### 5. Testing in the Software Engineering Process (10 minutes)
- **Activity:** Explain how testing integrates with software development:
  - Test design and planning
  - Test cases and coverage

- **Objective:** Show the systematic approach to testing.

### 6. Testing in an AI Age: Automation (5 minutes)
- **Activity:** Introduce the concept of automated testing and continuous regression testing.
- **Objective:** Emphasize modern testing practices.

### 7. Hands-On Exercise (15 minutes)
- **Activity:**
  - Students will create a simple test plan, write test cases, and develop a basic RTM for a given scenario.
- **Resources:** Access to GitHub Codespace with the software environment.
- **Objective:** Apply learned concepts in a practical setting.

### 8. Wrap-Up and Questions (5 minutes)
