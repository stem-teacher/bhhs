# Hands-On Exercise Details

## Scenario

You are part of a development team working on a simple calculator application. The application should perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Requirements (SRS in Markdown Files)

1. **REQ-001**: The calculator shall perform addition of two numbers.
2. **REQ-002**: The calculator shall perform subtraction of two numbers.
3. **REQ-003**: The calculator shall perform multiplication of two numbers.
4. **REQ-004**: The calculator shall perform division of two numbers.
5. **REQ-005**: The calculator shall display an error message when attempting to divide by zero.

## Tasks

### 1. Create a Test Plan

Outline the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of the testing activities.

**Components to include**:

- **Test Objectives**
- **Test Scope**
- **Test Environment**
- **Roles and Responsibilities**
- **Schedule**

### 2. Develop Test Cases

For each requirement, create test cases specifying:

- **Test Case ID**
- **Test Description**
- **Preconditions**
- **Test Steps**
- **Expected Results**

### 3. Create a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

Link each test case back to its corresponding requirement.

**RTM Template**:

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                          | Test Case IDs |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| REQ-001        | The calculator shall perform addition...         | TC-001, TC-002|
| REQ-002        | The calculator shall perform subtraction...      | TC-003        |
| ...            | ...                                              | ...           |

## Instructions

- Use your GitHub Codespace to document your test plan, test cases, and RTM.
- Save your work in markdown files for consistency.
- Collaborate with peers if needed but ensure you understand each part.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

- A basic **test plan** outlining how you will test the calculator application.
- A set of **test cases** for each requirement.
- An **RTM** that maps each test case to its requirement.

# Additional Notes

- Focus on clarity and completeness.
- Think about edge cases, such as dividing by zero.
- Remember the importance of traceability in testing.
