A workbook in the context of a formal software engineering process is a structured collection of documents that guide the development, implementation, and validation of software systems. Each workbook addresses a specific phase of the software development lifecycle, ensuring consistency, traceability, and compliance. Workbooks serve as central repositories, capturing the requirements, designs, test approaches, and decisions made throughout the project.

The [**Specification Workbook**](/workbooks/specification) outlines the detailed requirements and constraints of the software, providing a foundation for design and development. The [**Design Workbook**](/workbooks/design) describes the architectural and component-level designs, ensuring that the system's structure aligns with the specified requirements. During the construction phase, the [**Construction Workbook**](/workbooks/construction) guides the implementation of code, documenting coding standards, configuration settings, and integration processes. Meanwhile, the [**Test Workbook**](/workbooks/test) covers testing strategies, test cases, and validation results to ensure the software meets quality and functional requirements.

In addition to these, a [**Standards Workbook**](/workbooks/standards) defines the coding conventions, documentation standards, and compliance requirements that the project must adhere to, ensuring uniformity and best practices across all phases. There is also a special [**HSC Workbook**](/workbooks/hsc) tailored for the subject High School Certificate (HSC), designed to align the software process with educational standards and assessment criteria. Together, these workbooks form a comprehensive framework that supports the structured and rigorous development of high-quality software systems.
