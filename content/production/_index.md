## **Production Overview**

The **production** aspect of the software engineering process focuses on the operational management and maintenance of software products once they are deployed. It covers key areas such as **operational status** and **performance monitoring** to ensure that systems run efficiently and meet user expectations. **Security Continuous Monitoring (ConMon)**, as outlined by the U.S. DoD, is integrated to maintain a secure production environment, addressing potential threats and compliance requirements in real-time.

This section also includes information on **deployments**, detailing how new features, updates, and patches are released with minimal disruption. **Downtime** and **production issue management** processes are covered, providing insights into how incidents are tracked, resolved, and documented to minimise impact. Additionally, **support issues** are addressed through structured support mechanisms, ensuring users have reliable access to assistance when needed. Together, these aspects form the backbone of a stable and secure production environment, critical for sustaining the softwareâ€™s operational integrity and user satisfaction.
